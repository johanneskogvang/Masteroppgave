\section{Problem Setup}

Small part about the inference and how we will do that.

%Then, something about that we first need the ideal observer solution. 
To be able to do that (describe that), we firstly need to find a model(?) for the Ideal Observer solution. In the specialization thesis we found one IO solution where we assumed that the number of red boxes is uniformly distributed with possible values $(0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12)$, where $6$ is not included here as one of the colours have to be in majority. 


Have one IO solution form the specialization thesis, generalising that one here to be able to have different prior for $\theta$. 

From the specialisation thesis we have the loss functions. Talk about the three different choices, and state the loss functions as you found them earlier. Then, say that you need those two probabilities, and say how you find them in this case
