This is the TMA4900 - Industrial Mathematics, Master's Thesis, which is part of my Master of Science in Applied Physics and Mathematics with an Industrial Mathematics major. I wish to thank my supervisor, HÃ¥kon Tjelmeland, for following up on me, answering my questions, and for helping me all the way through. I would also like to thank Kristoffer Klevjer and Gerit Pfuhl for introducing me to this project and providing me with data.

    Delusions is one of the main symptoms of schizophrenia, and delusion prone individuals have been linked to a 'jumping to conclusions' bias. That means making decisions without enough information about the thing one are making them about. An information sampling task called the box task has been proposed as a way to find if participants have this bias. In the box task we have a grid of grey boxes that, when they are opened, displays one out of two colours. The participants are told that one of the colours always is in majority, and their task is to find out which one. Two versions of the box task are used here, one where the participants can open as many boxes as they want and another where the test terminates when a random box is opened. We have data from 76 participants that have done both versions of the box task, and in this report we model how they make decisions. We find parameter estimates using maximum likelihood and find confidence intervals using parametric bootstrapping. Lastly, we find an Ideal Observer solution of the box task, where an Ideal Observer is someone who would make the optimal choice each time a box is opened.
