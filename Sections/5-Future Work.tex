\chapter{Future Work/Closing Remarks}

Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expand the model to fit the decisions better
    \item remove alpha form limited. However, alpha might be useful when choosing badly, but early. as the two individuals with alpha different from zero do. 
    \item explore the solutions with different priors better
\end{itemize}
